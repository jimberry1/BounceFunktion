# BounceFunktion

The BounceFunktion is an online community for sharing good electronic music. The site offers a real-time music feed where users update friends with their latest tracks, as well as offering a space to save favourites and track user post history. The group originated on Facebook however a tailored app provides more customisation and control when making posts. The aim of this project is to provide a front-end application accessible to users accessing the site using multiple devices.

# Features

- MUSIC INTEGRATION: Share posts from Spotify, Soundcloud and Youtube which will be automatically embedded into the feed. 

- FEED: Real-time updates for posts, likes and comments facilitate the responsive feel of the community. 

- EVENTS: Post and advertise a range of events, from nights out to live music to festivals and let your friends register their interest

- PROFILE: Customise your profile and track your engagement with the community


# Mobile integration

The application is fully displayable on a range of mobile devices, with styling catered for both PC and mobile users. I also have a plan to develop the application into a PWA, with the groundwork manifest having already been created. 

# Next steps

As well as a mobile platform for music we are also looking to integrate the site into the Facebook Graph API, allowing for post platform posts to increase visibility and maximise engagement.
